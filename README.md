THIS PROJECT ISN'T FINISHED YET. ANY HELP APPRECIATED

README COMING SOON!

## IDEA
The Name of this project literally tells you everything Important. I wanna build a custom Whatsapp Client for the Cardputer. Since the Cardputer just is an ESP 32

## How to run (if it works)

1. Compile with PlatformIO 
2. Run Server in your Network with NodeJS [Server.js](./server/server.js)

## Goals
-[] Make it work in the local Network
-[] Integrate some sort of port forwarding or sth like that 
-[] More features?? / Integrations ??
