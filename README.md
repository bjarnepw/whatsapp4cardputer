## IDEA
The Name of this project literally tells you everything Important. I wanna build a custom Whatsapp Client for the Cardputer. Since the Cardputer just is an ESP 32 we need an extra Server for that.

## How to run (if it works)

1. Compile with PlatformIO 
2. Run Server in your Network with NodeJS [Server.js](./server/server.js)

## Goals
- [ ] Make it work in the local Network
- [ ] Integrate some sort of port forwarding or sth like that 
- [ ] More features?? / Integrations ??
